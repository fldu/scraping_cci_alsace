# CCI Alsace company scraper
This is a small project in order for me to learn scraping and how to distribute code. Definitely not perfect but it does the job

## How to make it work?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fldu/scraping_cci_alsace
cd scraping_cci_alsace
docker-compose build 
docker-compose --compatibility up -d 
```

Then retrieve the output.xlsx from the client
